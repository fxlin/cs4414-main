In one semester, it takes students, who have basic knowledge of the computer software/hardware stack, on the journey of building a modern operating system.</p> <p>Building an OS can be a tough process, and this course is designed to give students continuous rewards -- both intellectually and emotionally -- just as video games or theme parks do.</p> <p>This course will start from bare-metal hardware (\"boot\") and incrementally build more features, enable more applications, and eventually run a full-fledged OS, which can run multiple applications (\"DOOM\") and on a multicore processor.</p>"},{"location":"#five-worlds","title":"Five worlds","text":"<p>We provide five OS versions: each is functional, but increasingly more \"modern\". The class assignments (called \"quests\") will involve completing key features in these OS versions, enabling more applications to run.</p> <p>World 1: Baremetal     A single CPU core can boot, print messages from UART, and display pixels. Interrupts work, enabling periodic rendering of a simple \"donut\" animation. Everything runs in privileged mode (EL1).</p> <p></p> <p>World 2: Embedded     This OS resembles what you would see in an \"embedded systems\" course. In addition to World 1 features, it can run multiple tasks and preempt their execution. However, everything still runs at EL1.</p> <p></p> <p>World 3: Minimal User     This OS introduces virtual memory and user/kernel separation. It provides syscalls and can run one or multiple \"Mario\" applications concurrently in userspace.</p> <p></p> <p>World 4: Simple User     The OS now includes file abstraction and file systems. Userspace is built independently of the kernel and executed via <code>exec()</code>. The OS implements more I/O drivers, notably USB keyboard and sound device, exposing them via <code>/proc</code> and <code>/dev</code> to userspace. Userspace comprises a simplified libc and applications including Mario, slider, shell, and a sound tester.</p> <p></p> <p>World 5: Rich User     The OS now boots on multicore (four in rpi3). It includes a FAT32 filesystem and an SD driver, allowing file exchange with PC or Mac. It also includes a \"SurfaceFlinger,\" allowing multiple apps to render on the screen and dispatching input events to the correct app. Userspace is more complete, including a full libc, as well as DOOM (a 3D game), a music player, and a blockchain miner.</p> <p></p> <p>World 5 demo (with sound):</p> <p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cf05a8e-84f1-4d20-8b01-3e8bcade7cd1</p>"},{"location":"#emulator-or-real-hardware","title":"Emulator or real hardware?","text":"<p>All the code and quests can run on both the emulator (QEMU) and real hardware (Raspberry Pi 3, or rpi3).

Each project consists of one or more assignments, some are questions/answers but more require programming. Class meetings mostly focus on these projects. </p> <p>Q2: is there any exam?</p> <p>No. </p> <p>Q3: is this course difficult? </p> <p>OS is supposed to be difficult otherwise I'm not doing my job. You need to: </p> <ul> <li>Have a right attitude. Try hard before seeking for help. </li> <li>Master tools, including debugger, git, Google, and ChatGPT</li> <li>Understand code details. </li> <li>Manage setback, emotion, and frustration. </li> </ul> <p>Q4: I have no idea what is going on with assignment X. Help!</p> <p>Have you read the project description and tinkered with the code? Instead of having a vague complaint, please state something concrete such as : \"I understand A. I think B means ... and did some experiments. But I do not know how to get C work. Please help.\" Then bring that to Piazza/OH. </p> <p>Q5: my code does not work. help! </p> <p>As the course goes on, some students will start directly throwing problems to instructors, expecting for answers. Example: \"my program does not work and here is the error message. What should I do?\" This is unacceptable. It's one thing that you attempted and sought for help; it's another thing \"my code breaks, what to do\". </p> <p>Q6: why there are too many low-level details? I am frustrated.  </p> <p>Once again, let me warn everybody there will be a lot of hacking, setbacks, and frustration. What else do you expect from an OS course? It's about plumbing, the dirty jobs that get the million lines of software working. If you expect OS class to be \"push button\" experiences, one that you can type a few commands and everything works magically w/o breaking, there is no such a thing. </p> <p>Q7: Why am I spending all time on code details, instead of learning OS concepts?</p> <p>I hope you attend every lecture, where we teach OS concepts. But if details prevent you from seeing the big picture, you are not spending enough time to master them. </p> <p>Q8: why are some lecture contents unrelated to projects? </p> <p>Lecture contents are a superset of the knowledge needed for the projects. Projects can only cover a small fraction of OS contents that students should know. We don't have enough time. </p>"},{"location":"syllabus-24sp/","title":"CS4414 Syllabus","text":"<p>Last updated: January 2024</p>"},{"location":"syllabus-24sp/#welcome-everyone","title":"WELCOME EVERYONE","text":"<p>You must read this FAQ before proceeding. </p>"},{"location":"syllabus-24sp/#logistics","title":"LOGISTICS","text":"<p>Tue/Thu (01/17/2024 to 04/30/2024) , 02:00 PM - 03:15 PM, Thornton Hall E316</p> <p>Zoom/recordings will be available</p>"},{"location":"syllabus-24sp/#instruction-team","title":"Instruction team","text":"<p>Instructor</p> <ul> <li>Prof. Felix Lin               xl6yq@virginia.edu</li> </ul> <p>TAs </p> <ul> <li>Wonkyo Choe (PhD student)             bfr4xr@virginia.edu</li> <li>Rongxiang Wang (PhD student)          waq9hw@virginia.edu</li> <li>Akhil Shekar (PhD student)     as8hu@virginia.edu</li> </ul> <p>Office hours:</p> <p>Location: Rice 442</p> <ul> <li>Mon   11-12p           </li> <li>Tue   10-11a</li> <li>Thu   1030-1130a (starting from Feb 22nd)</li> <li> <p>Thu  330-430p            </p> </li> <li> <p>The TAs will: answer questions; give suggestions on your code; offer debugging pointers</p> </li> <li>The TAs will not: write or debug your code for you </li> </ul>"},{"location":"syllabus-24sp/#grading-submission","title":"GRADING &amp; SUBMISSION","text":""},{"location":"syllabus-24sp/#projects","title":"Projects","text":"<p>Most of your time (like &gt;80%) will be spent on four projects. </p> <p>Each project has one or more assignments.
